# cmd-flood-batch-file-v1
cmd flood, to flood PC's RAM, ofc only works on windows


you can put this on the startup folder of windows, so when you start your PC you can't use it anymore
Windows button + R to launch run and type "shell:startup:

- if you want to delete the batch file in the startup folder, but ofc you can't because you can't use your PC
boot it in safe mode so startups dont run
and you can delete it peacefully
